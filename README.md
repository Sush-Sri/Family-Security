Today, many new technological developments have occurred. As a result of these technological developments, people may face several crucial problems. Some of the negativities to be experienced with the detection of such problems can be minimized through various approaches. Because of this; it is necessary to fall in parallel with technological and scientific developments, traffic accidents are still at the forefront people's daily life both in our country and also all over the world. Compared to air, sea and railway traffic, traffic on highways continues to be a significant problem in current life. Because no human being cannot be thought without driving out on a daily basis, traffic accident are considered to be an ordinary event of each human being. For this reason, it is essential for any person who involved in a traffic accident to objectively present the possible defect situations in a technical, legal and scientific way. So, vehicle detection and tracking systems gather lots of attention from the researcherâ€™s and is highly focused on by people. By detecting the number of cars in traffic prone area we can minimize the speed of car accordingly. This will minimize the traffic of that particular area and prevent the accidents. This project provide the family security by sending each data on their mobile phone.
